# langchain_exploration
Trying out applications of langchain and LLMs

Hoping to add notebooks of amazing applications and ideas😁😁😁

HIGHLIGHT:
    Agent_Converse_files: Can now converse between a resume and job listing.
    and is able to identify if the skills match or not.
    STILL IN PROGRESS. throws an error that i need to check why...

1. agent_trial notebook is an intro to agents and how they work

2. converse_two_embeddings is my trial and research into how i can have two different types of files, create embeddings for them and have a conversation that essentially comapres the files. ---> This is a work in progress.
